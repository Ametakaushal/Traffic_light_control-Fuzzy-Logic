Project: Fuzzy Logic for Traffic Light Control
This project uses fuzzy logic to manage traffic lights at a two-road intersection. Traffic density on each road is used as input to determine the green light duration for each road.

Inputs: Traffic density of Road 1 and Road 2 (categorized as low, medium, or high).
Output: Green light duration (categorized as short, medium, or long).
Objective: Improve traffic flow efficiency and reduce congestion using intelligent decision-making.
Designing a fuzzy system to control traffic light duration based on traffic density.
